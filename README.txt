 a slick little one-pager with a super vibrant color palette (which
I guess you can always tone down if it's a little too vibrant for you), a "sticky" in-page
nav bar (powered by my Scrollex plugin), a separate generic page template (just in case
you need one), and an assortment of pre-styled elements.
